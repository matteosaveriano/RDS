# Reshaped Dynamical Systems (RDS)

An implementation of the RDS approach described in [(Saveriano and Lee, 2018)]([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11290.pdf](https://elib.dlr.de/121743/1/Incremental_Learning_DS.pdf)).

## Demo description
- `main_LASA.m`: a demo to run RDS on the LASA Handwriting dataset.

## Software Requirements
The code is developed and tested under `Matlab2023b`.
